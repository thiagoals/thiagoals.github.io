# Gentelella

Updated to Angular 7 project, generated by ANGULAR-CLI and then modified to utilize the Gentelella free bootstrap theme. I tried to use bootstrap 4 reference, but this leads to various UI formatting issues, so pointed back to bootstrap 3. Bootstrap is a CDN reference. Jquery and jquery-flot are imported as scripts directly, because jquery-flot is legacy non-module javascript. Everything else is referenced from NPM now.

Some of the dependencies are currently flagging as high risk, but can't be updated automatically. I haven't tried to do a manual fix for these. Some of the libraries this is depending on unfortunately haven't been updated in quite a long time - most notably jquery-flot. Probabably ideal at this point in time would be to replace jquery-flot with some other charting library.

It does not currently have support for all the pages of existing gentelella, and some of the javascript tools (like pie charts) needed for dashboard controls have (still) not yet been incorporated in project.

To run, clone/fork the repo, and then do npm install.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
